    "### The tools \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keras\n",
    "Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case I will be using Keras with a Tensorflow back-end. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### tqdm \n",
    "Simply just a tool for showing cool progress bars. It's nice to know the progress when working on big data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    "- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    "- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matplotlib.pyplot\n",
    "\n",
    "pyplot is used for plotting data. e.g., create a figure, create plotting area in a figure, plot some lines in a plotting area, decorate the plot with labels, etc.\n",
    "#### TODO: Fill inn as you go\n"
